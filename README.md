Total Marks: 12

Late Submission: 20% penalty if delayed by one week. 50% penalty if delayed by two week. No
evaluation after that.

1. For a given input array, write a code to construct a Max-Heap using the following algorithms.
The code should use inherently the same algorithms which were discussed in the class. (4
Marks)

(a) Build-Max-Heap
(b) Max-Heap-Insert

2. Implement a stack using Max-Heap. Here, you have to implement the Push(), Pop(), Isempty(),
and isFull() operations. (2 Marks)

3. (a) Implement Heap Sort, Counting Sort, Radix Sort and Bucket Sort. The inputs for the linear
sorts should be taken in such a way that their time complexity will remain O(n). (4 Marks)

(b) Plot a graph to compare the execution time of these four sorting algorithms. The Y-axis in the
graph represents the execution time of the program and X-axis represents the size of the input array.
Different sizes of the input array will be 103, 104, 105, 106, and 107. For each input size, generate
multiple input arrays and record the execution time for each input array. Now, take the average of
the execution times which will be considered as the final value of the execution time to be plotted
corresponding to the input size. A small program can be written to generate different input array for
a given input size. (2 Marks)
