1. Write code for following problems using dynamic programming: (4.5 Marks)

(a) Matrix Multiplication: The input will be the number of matrices with their dimensions. The output
will be the parenthesisation of the matrices and number of multiplications due to the optimal
parenthesisation.

(b) Longest Common Subsequence: Input will be two strings and output will be all possible longest
common subsequences.

(c) 0-1 Knapsack Problem: Input is Capacity of Knapsack, weight and profit of the objects. Output will
be the maximum profit.

2. Write code for following problems using greedy approach:

(a) Job sequencing: Input is Deadline and profit of the jobs. Output is total profit and sequence of
execution of the jobs. (1.5 Marks)

(i) adjacency list representations.
(ii) adjacency matrix representations.

(c) Kruskal’s algorithms to find minimum spanning tree (MST) of a graph using (3 Marks)
